Tasks Overview
Task 1: Web Scraping using Python
In this task, I worked on extracting real-time data from a website using **BeautifulSoup**.  
The scraped data (quotes and authors) was cleaned and saved into a **CSV file** for further analysis.  
This task helped me understand how raw data can be collected from web sources.

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This task focused on analyzing a dataset of student marks.  
I calculated important statistics such as average, highest, and lowest scores, and visualized the data using graphs.  
It helped me understand patterns and trends within the data.
